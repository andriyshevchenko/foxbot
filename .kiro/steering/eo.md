# TypeScript Code Generation Rules [v1.0]

## Usage Guide

- Rules have severity: [C]ritical, [H]igh, [M]edium, [L]ow
- When rules conflict: Higher severity wins â†’ Existing code patterns take precedence
- Process rules by severity (Critical first)

## Architecture & Structure [A]

- **[A1-C]** The existing code structure must not be changed without a strong reason.
