# Context7.Context7 MCP Usage Guidelines

## Overview

When working with external libraries, frameworks, or APIs, leverage the Context7.Context7 MCP server to pull up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source.

## When to Use Context7.Context7 MCP

- **Library Integration**: When implementing features that use external libraries or frameworks
- **API Documentation**: When working with REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, or other web services
- **Version-Specific Code**: When you need examples that match specific versions of dependencies
- **Best Practices**: When looking for current best practices and patterns from official sources
- **Troubleshooting**: When debugging issues that might have known solutions in documentation

## Benefits

- **Always Current**: Gets the latest documentation directly from source repositories
- **Version Accurate**: Ensures code examples match the specific versions you're using
- **Authoritative**: Pulls from official sources rather than potentially outdated tutorials
- **Context Aware**: Provides relevant examples based on your specific use case
- **Comprehensive**: Includes both documentation and real code examples from the source

## Usage Pattern

1. **Identify the Need**: When you encounter a library, framework, or API you need to work with
2. **Use Context7**: Pull the relevant documentation and examples using the MCP server
3. **Apply Context**: Use the retrieved information to inform your implementation
4. **Validate**: Cross-reference with your specific version requirements

## Example Scenarios

- Implementing authentication with a specific OAuth library
- Using a new React component library with current best practices
- Integrating with a third-party API using their latest SDK
- Following framework-specific patterns (Next.js, Express, etc.)
- Understanding breaking changes between library versions

## Integration with Development Workflow

- Use Context7 during the **design phase** to understand capabilities and constraints
- Reference during **implementation** to ensure correct usage patterns
- Leverage during **troubleshooting** to find known solutions and workarounds

This approach ensures that all implementations are based on current, accurate, and authoritative information rather than potentially outdated or incorrect examples from secondary sources.
